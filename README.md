# urban-coder
A repository of all my projects 

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects that demonstrate skills in using Python and SQL to extract insights and value from large and complex datasets. Each project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to perform data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization, and SQL queries to extract and transform data from relational databases. The projects cover a variety of topics and techniques, including exploratory data analysis, classification. and more. By completing these projects, I gained an understanding of how to leverage the power of Python and SQL to solve real-world data analysis problems and derive valuable insights from data.
